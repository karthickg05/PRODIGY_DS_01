# 🌍 Population Distribution Visualization - Prodigy Data Science Task

This project is part of a Data Science internship task at **Prodigy InfoTech**. It visualizes the global population distribution using histograms and bar charts based on recent world population data.

---

## 📌 Task Objective

Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the **distribution of population across countries**.

---

## 📊 Dataset

- **Dataset Source:**  
  [worldpopulationdata.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kindo-tk/PRODIGY_DS_01/main/worldpopulationdata.csv)

- **Columns Used:**
  - `Country Name`
  - `2022` (Population in 2022)

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Google Colab

---

## 📈 Visualizations

### 1. Histogram

- Shows the distribution of 2022 population across all countries.
- Uses **log scale** on the x-axis to handle skewed population values.

### 2. Bar Chart

- Displays the **Top 10 most populous countries** in 2022.
- Horizontal bar chart for better readability.

---

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Copy and paste the full script into a new notebook
3. Run all cells to visualize the charts
